## Planned Features

-   A game matching live room where up to 10 users can connect in a "room" and match games live.
-   More user customization and allow ability to reset recommendation algorithm.
-   Allow site to work on multiple languages and get region specific games.
-   Block feature, API limiter, content safety features, and terms of use warnings.

## Purpose

All gamers have had that moment when they are sitting around saying "what game should we play". The steam layout does not help, the recommendation engine is not great, and it's hard to find new games.

GamesLink solves this problem using a fresh layout and A.I. powered features.
